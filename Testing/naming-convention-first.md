## Naming Conventions First
If you write auto-tests in your free time, you likely spend additional hours refactoring your tests. You definitely have
problems with defined code guidelines in your tests. The first point of any guideline in a project should be defined
naming conventions for every instance and line in your codebase, from file, methods, and module names to test titles and
descriptions.

It may seem boring to define and then follow the confirmed naming patterns, but proper naming simplifies understanding
of the project structure and benefits you by saving time in the long run.

Without consistent naming conventions, a project becomes a confusing mess.

Consistent naming conventions streamline communication, making each term more meaningful and errors easier to identify
and correct, often with the help of automation.

With clear, consistent rules, projects run smoother, bugs are caught earlier, and metrics make sense.

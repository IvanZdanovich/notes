## Test Automation Doesn't Work

Hi, if you have an annoying feeling that you're not getting the full potential out of modern test automation, you're
probably right. Here are some signs that your project might be falling short:

1. **Inconsistent Pass Rates**: If you don't have a 100% pass rate, it's a straightforward health check failure. Any
   failing tests should immediately trigger bug reports or fixes for flaky tests. Otherwise, your CI/CD process will
   likely require manual approvals, leading to policy bypasses and delays in product delivery.

2. **Mirroring Manual Test Cases**: Automated tests should not simply replicate manual test cases. This approach
   requires extra effort for implementation and maintenance without added benefits. It also necessitates additional
   preconditions to keep tests independent, which can lead to performance issues.

3. **Lack of Naming Conventions**: Consistent naming conventions for application parts, test descriptions, titles,
   functions, and methods are crucial. Without them, understanding what part of the application a test verifies becomes
   difficult. Inconsistent naming is like making a pizza with whatever ingredients are currently in the fridge, leading
   to a chaotic and unstructured test suite.

4. **Outdated Test Cases**: If you can't remember the last time you updated an automated test case, it means your test
   suite is managing you, not the other way around. Modern projects require continuous updates to test cases to reflect
   changing requirements. Like a surgeon, you need to accurately identify outdated tests, remove them, and seamlessly
   integrate replacements.

5. **Scattered Requirements**: If you're looking for requirements in various sources like chats with POs, BAs,
   developers, or testers, you lack stable expected results. In modern projects, especially those with limited budgets
   for business analysts, the best approach is to store requirements within the test code base as expected results. For
   more details, check out my approach
   in [Integrating Requirements into the Codebase](requirements-integration-practical-approach.md).

6. **Generic Test Tags**: Using generic tags like smoke or regression for filtering your test suite is not effective.
   Instead, filter tests using clear and straightforward characteristics that are not subject to change. For more
   insights, see my post on [Test Tagging Strategy Without Tags](tagging-strategy.md).

7. **Multiple Checks in One Block**: Follow the rule of one requirement per check. Checks should be atomic and granular.
   Without this, any metrics based on tests, from coverage to duration, will be inaccurate, and maintaining test cases
   will become an endless task.

8. **Lack of a Test Repository Pipeline**: Without a pipeline for your test repository, you can't ensure the quality of
   tests or track their condition after updates.

### Summary

Do you know any testing project without these issues? If so, you're lucky. Most developers are not as meticulous with
source code as they should be, which is why tests and test automation are necessary. To bring value, test automation
must be more precise than the code being tested. This requires more restrictions and responsibility. If these properties
can't be provided in your test automation, it might not be worth starting.

# Principles
PURPOSE: guide production of token-efficient self-contained SKILL.md
SEGMENTATION: one skill per responsibility, one section per concept, one tag per rule
SCOPE: .claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
SECTIONS: frontmatter, principles, custom sections, validation
FRONTMATTER: name (kebab-case), description (one-line trigger sentence)
HEADING_LEVELS: H1 major sections
TAG_FORMAT: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE: value
TAG_STYLE: desired pattern as noun tag, positive framing, stable vocabulary
LIST_STYLE: comma-separated inline for compact sets
THE_OTHER_WAY_AROUND: define what the skill prevents, not just what it produces — use REVERSE_BRAINSTORM tags
REVERSE_BRAINSTORM: prevent restated content across skills, narrative prose, generic tag names and values, mix of tag responsibilities

# Validation
TAG_CHECK: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE, one rule per line, noun-led
FRAMING_CHECK: positive guidance and desired patterns throughout
TOKEN_CHECK: no filler phrases, no narrative prose, meaningful signals only
SCOPE_CHECK: frontmatter description matches the skill's actual trigger
PATH_CHECK: declared paths exist in the workspace
SECTION_CHECK: mandatory sections present — Principles, Validation

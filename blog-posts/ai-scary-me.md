## AI Scares Me

I need a moment of self-therapy. I have a problem - the possibilities of artificial intelligence scare me.

No, it's not that it will take over the world. I'm afraid of losing the competition. No, not with artificial
intelligence.

Competition with other people? Yes, a little.

But even more, I fear losing to my ego. All my previous life, I could deceive myself with excuses that I had fewer
opportunities, unsuitable conditions, inappropriate experience, or unclear prospects. All these excuses have become even
more ridiculous.

Today, I have everything - a mentor, a guide, a companion, a helper. I have everything I need to create a valuable
product. Today, I am more efficient than ever, but I am losing to my ego like never before.

What calms me? I see that we all are getting better, taking on more complex tasks, and making better decisions.

Better decisions will make the future brighter. The future is ours to shape, and it promises to be extraordinary.

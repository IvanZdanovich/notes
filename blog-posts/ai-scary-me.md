## AI Scares Me – and That’s a Good Thing

I need a moment of self-therapy. The possibilities of artificial intelligence scare me—not because I think it will take
over the world, but because of the competition it creates.

Not competition with AI itself. Not even just with other people.

What truly scares me is losing to my own ego.

For years, I could tell myself I lacked the right opportunities, the right conditions, the right experience. Those
excuses don’t hold up anymore. Today, I have everything—AI as a mentor, a guide, a companion, a helper. I have all the
tools to create something valuable.

I’m more efficient than ever, yet I find myself grappling with the same internal battles. The only thing standing in my
way now—is me.

But here’s what gives me hope: AI is pushing all of us to get better, to take on more complex challenges, to make
smarter decisions. And better decisions will shape a brighter future.

The future isn’t something to fear—it’s ours to build. And it’s going to be extraordinary.
